## Usage

### Creating an instance

To create an instance of SyncfyWidget, you need to create an element in the DOM with a unique selector. By default SyncfyWidget will search for "#widget". Here's an example.

```
<div id="widget"></div>
```

Once you have the element, you're ready to instantiate a new SyncfyWidget with your desired configuration.

```
// Any of the following formats may be used

var syncfyWidget = new SyncfyWidget("syncfy_token");

var syncfyWidget = new SyncfyWidget({
        token: "syncfy_token"
    });

var syncfyWidget = new SyncfyWidget({
        token: "syncfy_token",
        element: "#widget",
        config: {
            locale: "es",
            entrypoint: {
                country: "MX"
            }
        }
    });

```
